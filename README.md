# iccImpact

A package with one function (i.e., `icc_type_i`), which calculates the expected Type-I Error rate given a particular ICC and sample size. The function was inspired by Musca, Kamiejski, Nugier, MÃ©ot, Er-Rafiy, and Brauer's (2018) "Data with hierarchical structure: Impact of intraclass correlation and sample size on Type-I error."
